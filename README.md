## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - build tool for web projects

### What I learned

Since this project is relatively simple, it was an opportunity to learn the basics of React JS. So, I learned about component architecture - how to break the design into small components and compose them into a bigger one, making the components more reusable. I also learned how to dynamically render a list of components using an array and its method Map and to use the Context Hook to share the heading level with different components without passing it as props.
Adding styles was also something that I learned, and aside from React, CSS animation was something that I dived into to figure out how to make the sequence animation of this project, using CSS variables and the calc property in the animation delay to make the sequence work.

### Continued development

I still have to improve how to structure a React project properly, which was one of the challenges I faced during this project. I also want to work with other React hooks to learn more about React and its capabilities. Besides that, I want to explore CSS frameworks and animation libraries.
